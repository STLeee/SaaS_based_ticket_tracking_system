## Task

### Description

Please design a SaaS based ticket tracking system. This system allows QA to report a bug and RD can mark a bug as resolved.

### Requirement

- Phase I Requirement:
    - There are two types of user: QA and RD.
    - Only QA can create a bug, edit a bug and delete a bug.
    - Only RD can resolve a bug.
    - Summary field and Description filed are must have of a bug when QA is creating a bug.

- Phase II Requirement:
    - All the users can leave any comments below a ticket.
    - Adding new field Severity and Priority to a ticket.
    - Adding new type of user "PM" that can create new ticket type "Feature Request". And only RD can mark it as resolved.
    - Adding new ticket type "Test Case" that only QA can create and resolve. It's read-only for other type of users.
    - Adding Administrator user that can manage all the staffs including adding new QA, RD and PM user.

### Task

- Task 1 - Please write down all the use cases either in text or diagram you can think for Phase I and Phase II requirement separately.
 
- Task 2 - Think of yourself as a cloud system architect. How will you design such system based on multiple micro-services? Please write down the design document at least to include system diagram, data flow diagram and sequence diagram across services.

- Task 3 - Please implement the A. Phase I Requirement by Java 11 + Spring Boot in back-end. For front-end, you can use any framework you like.

- Task 4 - Pack your services as Docker container images. And deploy them onto one of any Kubernetes platforms such as AKS, EKS or GKE â€¦etc, even more minikube or the standalone Kubernetes in Docker Desktop.
 
- Task 5 - Deploy your micro-services with one of any Service Mesh frameworks which supports not only Load Balancing but also Traffic Shifting mechanisms.

### Note

- Note 1: You do not need to finish all of the tasks, but please do your best to complete as much as you can.

- Note 2: Requirements may not be very clear, but please do your best to finish them.

- Note 3: (Optional) Technical requirements is listed below do your best to include the following modules as much as you can.

    1.	Spring Boot with the following latest version
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.6.2/reference/htmlsingle/

    2.	Use Maven as your project management tool
https://maven.apache.org

    3.	You can choose any type of Database without limitation like SQL or NOSQL. But please apply to Spring Data for the Data Access Object.
http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/ 

    4.	You can pack your Java application easily with jib-maven-plugin.

    5.	If you have no idea on determining the Service Mesh framework, Istio will be a good choice of it.
